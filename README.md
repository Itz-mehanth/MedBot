# MedBot

This medical chatbot assists users with disease prediction, medical report analysis, and general health-related queries. It uses finetuned LLM's like MedLLaMA2 and LLaMA 3.2 along with Machine Learning approaches like SVM, KNN that are used on an Intel version of scikit-learn to provide accurate predictions and insights. The chatbot also allows users to upload medical reports and get them summarized, offering lifestyle recommendations and answering doubts about their health. It also allows users to enter their symptoms, get a preliminary diagnosis as well as know more and ask questions about it. This feature can be used to aid admission of patients and streamlining resource management in hospitals.

## Features
- **Disease Prediction and Disease Query redressal**: Predicts diseases based on user input processed using KNN, SVM, Chi 2 scores, LLaMa3.2 and MedLLaMA2.
- **Medical Report Analysis**: Upload medical reports for analysis and receive a concise summary through Retrieval augmented generation.
- **Report Upload & Doubts**: Users can upload medical reports and ask specific questions or clarify doubts about the reports.

## Instructions to run Frontend
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
